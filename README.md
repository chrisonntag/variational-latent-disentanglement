# Towards understanding the structure of latent spaces in Variational Autoencoders

Reconstructing and understanding decisions made by machine learning models becomes more and more
important since used in areas that have great impact on societies and may directly affect people’s lives.

This project’s goal is to contribute to the understanding and visualization of latent spaces in Variational
Autoencoders based on labour market data. The main idea of using Autoencoders is in general that by
reducing dimensions from the input space while trying to resemble the input from this lower dimensional
representation at the same time leads to a compressed version of usually high dimensional input spaces that
contain just as much information to describe the input properly and can thus be further investigated and
used for various applications. However, due to the loss of any intrinsical meaning of latent dimensions,
interpretation is not intuitively possible – even in human-understandable two-dimensional spaces. In
addition to that, variables do not correspond with individual features of the input space directly but
may resemble combinations of multiple ones. Therefore, imposing structure on latent spaces may help
to further understand hidden relationships in data. This project will focus on two individual parts:
The review, proposal and qualitative evaluation of methods for disentanglement and the building of a
hierarchical structure on latent spaces and possible visualizations that help users to understand abstract
representations of data which should also be interpretable by non-expert users.
